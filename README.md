# EnderSpecimina

This and that from me, in a public mod. Formerly called "Fix2b2tGhostItems" (remove that old mod when using this).

Currently only for 1.21.4.

Current features:
 - Fix 2b2t Ghost Items
 - Fix 2b2t Bundles 
 - Scroll Zoom
 - Highway Visualization on Xaero Mini-/World-Map (from [HWU's Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/siw620fvnu) for 2b2t Nether)

See descriptions in Mod for explanations and more details on these Specimina.

Needs [Yet Another Config Library (YACL)](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) to run. So install this as well or the white dialog may haunt you.
